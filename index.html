Hi! I'm Ryan, a mechanical engineer with a strong interest in data analytics, applied machine learning, and web development.

Before transitioning into engineering, I worked as a web developer at a startup, where I focused on UI/UX design and API development. That early experience laid the foundation for my passion for building practical, user-focused digital tools.

Today, I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, data, and software â€” applying analytical thinking to solve real-world problems and build useful applications.
