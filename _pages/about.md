Hi! I'm **Ryan Goh**, a Mechanical Engineer based in Malaysia with a strong interest in data analytics, applied machine learning, and web development.

Before transitioning into engineering, I worked as a web developer at a startup, where I focused on UI/UX design and API development. That early experience laid the foundation for my passion for building practical, user-focused digital tools. 

Today, I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, data, and software — applying analytical thinking to solve real-world problems and build useful applications like [ASME-PVDE](/blog/ASME-PVDE-feature-overview/).

## Professional Focus

- 🔍 **Data Analytics:** Extracting insights from complex engineering data using Python, SQL, and PowerBI.
- 🤖 **Machine Learning:** Applying ML techniques for predictive maintenance, modeling, and automation.
- 🌐 **Web Development:** Building responsive full-stack web applications with React, Node.js, and Jekyll.
- 🛠️ **Engineering Mindset:** Applying systematic problem-solving and design thinking from my mechanical engineering background to the digital space.
