Hi! I'm Ryan, a mechanical engineer with a strong interest in data analytics, applied machine learning, and web development.

Before transitioning into engineering, I worked as a web developer at a startup, where I focused on UI/UX design and API development. That early experience laid the foundation for my passion for building practical, user-focused digital tools.

Today, I enjoy working at the intersection of engineering, data, and software — applying analytical thinking to solve real-world problems and build useful applications.

## What I Do

- 🔍 Data Analytics: Extracting insights from data using Python, SQL, and visualization tools.
- 🤖 Machine Learning: Applying ML techniques for predictive modeling and automation.
- 🌐 Web Development: Building full-stack web applications with modern frameworks.
- 🛠️ Engineering Mindset: Applying systematic problem-solving and design thinking from my mechanical engineering background.
