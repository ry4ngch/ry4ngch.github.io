Hi! I'm **Ryan Goh**, a Mechanical Engineer based in Malaysia. My career is defined by a unique blend of traditional engineering discipline and modern software development expertise. 

I specialize in building tools that live at the intersection of **Mechanical Design, Data Analytics, and Web Architecture.**

## The Bridge Between Two Worlds

My journey began in the fast-paced **startup ecosystem as a Web Developer**, where I honed my skills in UI/UX design and API development. This foundation in software architecture allows me to approach mechanical engineering problems with a "digital-first" mindset. 

Today, I apply that analytical thinking to solve real-world problems—whether it’s automating complex code calculations for pressure vessels or building scalable React frameworks.



## Professional Focus & Core Competencies

### 🔍 Engineering Data Analytics
I leverage **Python (Pandas, NumPy)** and **R** to extract actionable insights from complex engineering datasets. My goal is to transform raw technical data into predictive models that drive better design decisions.

### 🤖 Applied Machine Learning
I am passionate about applying ML techniques to the industrial sector, focusing on **Predictive Maintenance** and **Design Optimization** to improve the lifecycle of mechanical systems.

### 🌐 Full-Stack Web Development
With a background in startup development, I build responsive applications using **React, Webpack 5, and Node.js**. My current project, a [React Boilerplate Library](/portfolio/react-boilerplates/), focuses on creating optimized scaffolding for scalable front-end systems.

### 🛠️ Mechanical Design & Automation
I possess deep domain knowledge in **ASME Section VIII Division 1** and **PED** compliance. My flagship project, the [ASME-PVDE](/portfolio/asme-pvde/), demonstrates my ability to build enterprise-grade automation tools using Excel VBA and Power Query.
