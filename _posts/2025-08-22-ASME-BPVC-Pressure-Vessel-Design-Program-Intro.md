# ASME PVDE Engineering Automation Tool
üõ†Ô∏è Simplifying Pressure Vessel Design with Excel + VBA

The ASME PVDE Engineering Automation Tool is a custom-built Excel VBA application designed to streamline pressure vessel component calculations in accordance with ASME Section VIII, Division 1. By integrating complex engineering logic into a user-friendly Excel interface, the tool empowers engineers to perform accurate, audit-ready calculations with minimal setup time.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Why This Tool?
- Automate component sizing and stress calculations  
- Provide a centralized database of ASME-compliant materials, flanges, piping, bolts, and gaskets  
- Enable fast, customizable workflows using Excel's familiar environment  
- Reduce human error through built-in code compliance checks  

It‚Äôs ideal for small to medium engineering teams looking for a practical, maintainable, and efficient solution‚Äîwithout needing to rely on complex FEA or high-end design software.
