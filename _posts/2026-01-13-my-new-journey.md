### From Niche Expertise to Widespread Capability

When I started developing **ASME PVDE** back in 2021, my goal was to bridge the gap between complex engineering codes and practical software. At the time, I saw niche knowledge of pressure vessel design as a high-value "moat." I spent months manually extracting material data from Section II Part D and translating Section VIII logic into VBA, believing that this specialized expertise was what set an engineer apart.

But as the tool evolved, so did my perspective. I realized that by building this software, I was essentially automating the very "secrets" I had spent years learning.

My eventual move into a different industry wasn’t driven by a lack of interest in engineering, but by this realization: the "slow grind" of repetitive, process-driven work was being commoditized. Stepping back gave me perspective — this wasn’t just my story; it reflected a broader shift across the industry. Knowledge that was once rare is now widely accessible, often just a few clicks or an AI prompt away.

When I first entered the world of pressure vessel and process equipment manufacturing, the industry was highly specialized. Only a handful of companies had the capability to fabricate **pressure vessels and electric heaters**, and knowledge was closely held. Today, the landscape is very different. More and more companies are entering this space — even those that previously focused solely on process instrumentation or sensors. Fabrication techniques are better documented, supply chains are more robust, and technical knowledge that was once guarded is now widely accessible.

The takeaway? The real differentiator is no longer just the ability to build. It is **who can interpret, apply, and systematize design requirements effectively**.

### Design Code Expertise: Still Valuable, But No Longer Exclusive

While design code expertise remains essential, manufacturing capability alone is no longer a rare competitive advantage. Building **ASME PVDE** taught me that if a modular Excel tool can handle thousands of material entries and complex calculations, then "knowing the code" is no longer the endgame — it’s the baseline.

**The shift from "Knowing" to "Validating":**  
In software development, AI has already turned once-specialized coding tasks into baseline capabilities. We are seeing the same trend in manufacturing. With more robust supply chains and digital tools, the barrier to entry has lowered. The emphasis is shifting from who can perform the calculation toward who can critically evaluate the system.

This is where the risk lies. Tools can accelerate work, but they can also dull judgment. Engineers must understand the foundational principles behind the tools they use — whether it’s a VBA macro or a generative AI — to ensure decisions remain informed and accountable, rather than simply dictated by an algorithm.

### What This Means for Engineers: Become the Architect

For engineers in traditional manufacturing roles, the message is clear: **standing still is no longer an option**. Experience alone, or the ability to navigate a single company’s internal procedures, is no longer a guarantee of long-term relevance.

My journey with **ASME PVDE** taught me that the most resilient engineers aren't just those who follow the code, but those who can **build bridges** between engineering logic, digital automation, and business value.

To stay relevant, engineers must shift their focus toward:

- **Cross-Disciplinary Literacy:** Don’t just learn the ASME code; learn how data flows from a design sheet to a procurement system.  
- **Building Your Own Tools:** You don’t need to be a full-stack developer. Whether it’s Excel VBA, Python, or low-code platforms, the ability to automate your own workflow is the modern version of "working smart."  
- **The "Validation" Mindset:** As AI and automation take over the "doing," your value lies in the "checking." You must be the one who knows the physics well enough to spot when the software produces an impossible result.

### Continuous Learning: The New Baseline

The core lesson is simple: **niche knowledge alone is no longer a moat**. Just as AI has transformed software development, manufacturing knowledge is becoming a commodity.

The true advantage comes from **adaptability and ownership**. You can no longer rely solely on a company to provide your learning path. The tools I built in 2021 were born out of a period of unemployment and curiosity; they became the foundation for where I am today.

Platforms like [**ASME PVDE**]({% post_url 2025-08-31-ASME-PVDE-feature-overview %}) are useful for preserving expertise, but ultimately, **mindset matters most**. Staying curious, building your own systems, and being capable of turning abstract knowledge into repeatable action is what determines your value in this new landscape.
