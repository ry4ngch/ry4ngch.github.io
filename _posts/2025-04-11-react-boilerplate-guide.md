Starting a React project can sometimes feel overwhelming, especially when youâ€™re unsure about which boilerplate to choose. Whether you're looking for a simple starting point or something with a bit more structure, this React Boilerplate collection has you covered. It offers four different versions tailored to different levels of complexity, giving you the flexibility to choose the right starting point based on your project needs.

Letâ€™s dive into each version and see what it offers:

## 1. react_bare: The Barebones React Setup

If you prefer starting with a clean slate, **react_bare** is the perfect choice. Itâ€™s a minimal setup that provides only the core essentials for working with React. Here's what you get:

- React and ReactDOM pre-installed  
- Babel for JSX compilation  
- Webpack for module bundling  
- No extra components, JavaScript, or CSS files  
- Empty SCSS files, ready for you to customize and style as needed  

This version is ideal if you want complete control over your projectâ€™s structure, without any pre-configured components or styling. Itâ€™s perfect for building a custom solution from the ground up.

**When to use:**

- You want to start a React project with no frills or pre-defined structure.
- You have a specific vision for how your project should be set up.
- You're comfortable setting up your own routing, state management, and styling.

## 2. react_basic: React with Bootstrap, Custom Components, and CSS

If you prefer a more feature-rich setup but still want to keep things flexible, **react_basic** is a great option. This version integrates **Bootstrap** for easy-to-use UI components and includes a sample **single-page app (SPA)** structure to help you get started quickly. Hereâ€™s what it offers:

- Bootstrap integration for quick styling and responsive components  
- A custom component built using utility classes (see the "salient" folder in the `utils` directory)  
- A sample SPA structure to kickstart development  
- A wide range of UI components like navbar, dropdown, buttons, cards, modals, etc.  

**When to use:**

- You need a ready-made layout with responsive UI components.
- You want a quick start for building a single-page app with a clean, organized structure.
- You prefer working with Bootstrapâ€™s utility classes to speed up development.

## 3. react_bootstrap: React with Bootstrap Offcanvas Navbar

If you're specifically looking for a React setup with **Bootstrap**, but want something more tailored, **react_bootstrap** provides exactly that. It comes with:

- Bootstrap 5 integration, installed via npm  
- A Navbar component using Bootstrapâ€™s Offcanvas design  

> **Note:** Bootstrap 5 currently has some issues with the latest SASS implementation. Webpack has been configured to ignore `@import` warnings to avoid build interruptions.

**When to use:**

- You prefer Bootstrap 5 and need a quick setup with a responsive design.
- You want a modern, Offcanvas-style navbar out of the box.
- You need a lightweight setup with Bootstrap's core features but donâ€™t want extra complexity.

## 4. react_tailwind: React with Tailwind CSS

For those who love the flexibility and speed of **Tailwind CSS**, this setup is a must-try. **react_tailwind** integrates Tailwind for fast styling and rapid iteration. Hereâ€™s what you get:

- Tailwind CSS integration for utility-first styling  
- A prebuilt Offcanvas Navbar (side nav) and a standard top navbar  

**When to use:**

- Youâ€™re building a small project or prototype and need to move quickly.
- You prefer Tailwindâ€™s utility-first approach for styling.
- You need flexibility in styling without the overhead of custom CSS.

> **Note:** While Tailwind is great for quick iterations, it may not be the best choice for large-scale projects due to its utility-based approach. As your project grows, managing large stylesheets can become cumbersome.

## Why Choose the Salient Library?

One of the standout features in the **react_basic** boilerplate is the inclusion of the **Salient** library. This library is designed to simplify the development process by removing the need to manually define custom states for controlling UI animations and effects.

### Key Benefits:

- Predefined animations and styles that integrate seamlessly with React  
- Simple structure for managing dynamic UI effects without complex state logic  
- A faster development workflow with reduced boilerplate  
- Reusable components that accept common HTML attributes  

> While controlling animations and effects in React is relatively straightforward, it often leads to managing multiple state variables, which can clutter your codebase. Salient abstracts this complexity, giving you more time to focus on building great features.
