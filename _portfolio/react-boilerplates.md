The **React Boilerplate** project is a personal initiative by **Ryan Goh** to build a robust, production-ready starting point for modern web applications. Moving away from standard CLI tools, this boilerplate offers deep control over the build process using **Webpack 5**.

While currently in active development, it serves as a growing library of best practices, reusable UI components, and performance optimizations tailored for scalable React applications.

{: .notice--info}
**Getting Started:** For a detailed walkthrough on setting up and using this library, check out my [React Boilerplate Guide](/blog/react-boilerplate-guide/).

## Engineering a Better Scaffold

Traditional boilerplates often include "bloat" that slows down performance. This project focuses on a "modular first" philosophy:

* **Webpack 5 Optimization:** Custom-configured for fast Hot Module Replacement (HMR), tree-shaking, and efficient asset bundling.
* **Component-Based Architecture:** Focused on building a library of highly reusable, atomic components that can be dropped into any project without friction.
* **Modern Tooling:** Integrated with Babel for ES6+ support, specialized loaders for SASS/CSS modules, and optimized image processing.
* **Performance Driven:** Designed with a 90+ Lighthouse score target in mind, utilizing lazy loading and code-splitting strategies.

## Features in Development

As this project evolves from a boilerplate into a comprehensive library, I am currently integrating:

1.  **Atomic Design System:** Expanding the base UI components to include complex patterns like data tables and custom form validation.
2.  **API Integration Layer:** A standardized way to handle asynchronous data fetching and error states across the application.
3.  **Advanced Documentation:** Developing a usage guide that demonstrates how to implement each component with minimal overhead.

## Why Build Custom?

Building a boilerplate from scratch allows for a deeper understanding of the **React Ecosystem**. It ensures that every dependency is accounted for and that the final bundle sent to the user is as lean as possible. This project is a testament to the intersection of **clean code** and **optimal user experience**.
